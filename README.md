# Vue App

This app simulates authentication and extracts out the currently logged-in user using Vuex and Composable API.

The default fake username and password used for authentication are "Tolu" and "12345". New ones can be created on the registration page.

On login, it displays a product page using data retrieved from [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/).

A demo is available on [Netlify](https://tolu-vue-exam.netlify.app)
